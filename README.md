This program takes information given by leads generated through our website and aggregates all of the data a sales rep will need to make a quote. Then, it emails that Data to the specified sales rep, and updates Hubspot and our Google Sheets "Database".

Sales reps could then respond to those emails and this program would dynamically update the status of leads in Google Sheets.

## Archival Note
This repo contained lots of sensitive information in it's initial creation. I did not know better at the time, nor did I know how to remove that info from previous versions. Now, I do. 

This was originally a completely private project. Since it was probably my biggest professional project written in Python I have decided to open it up after redacting sensitive info.

The code is honestly a huge mess. Looking back on it now, there was so much that I did not know. It did, however do it's job and made my life a lot easier.
