# DC-marketing-funneltron
This repo allows everyone I work with to track who has entered the marketing funnel and been contacted and who has not and I don't have to do anything. :)

## Archival Note
This repo contained lots of sensitive information in it's initial creation. I did not know better at the time, nor did I know how to remove that info. Now, I do. 

This was originally a completely private project. Since it was probably my biggest professional project written in Python I have decided to open it up after redacting a lot of sensitive info.

This code is honestly a huge mess. Looking back on it now there was so much that I did not know. It did, however do it's job and made my life a lot easier.
